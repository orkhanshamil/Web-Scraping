# Web-Scraping 
Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Organizing data with Pandas.

In BS_random.ipynb file I used BeautifulSoup library to parse pythons random module function names and descriptions and then with help of Pandas converted that data to csv file.

Web scraping with Mechanicalsoup

In BS_image_download.ipynb I used Mechanicalsoup to search for a word in google and then download  all images of the first page and save it in one folder.
